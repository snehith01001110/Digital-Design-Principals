<center>Probability - Mathematical Foundation

- Definition: **Sample space** S is the finest-grain set of all possible outcomes of an experiment 
- Interpretation: "every time you run the experiment, the outcome is. exactly one element of S"
- Officially: The elements of S are mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive 
  - collectively exhaustive means includes all values 



<h2>Example 1 
S = { H,T }, coin toss (S is a discrete set)

<h2>
  Example 2
</h2>

S = { x:0 < x < infinity } 

​	say, time interval until arrival of next packet (S is continuous, unbounded)



------



- Definition: **Event** A is a subset of sample space S, i.e., A ⊆ S
- Interpretation: "The event A occurs if the experiment outcome belonds to A"

<h2>Example 1

</h2>

S = { 1,2,3,4,5,6 }, i.e. die roll

Some possible events (subsets of S):

{ 3 }: outcome is 3

{ 1,3,5 }: "outcome is odd"

S: "the sure event"



------



- Definition: **Probability** is a function P(*) defined over events (satisfying certain requirements)
- Interpretation: "measures how likely these events are; we saw P(A) is the probability of event A"
- The function P(*) must satisfy the **Axioms** 
  - P(A) >= 0 
  - P(S) = 1
  - P($$\cup$$ $$A_i$$) = $$\sum$$ P($$A_i$$)
    - if $$A_i \bigcap A_j = \phi$$



------

- These Axioms ensure all the properties we expect from a proper probability function

- For exampleL they imply P(A) <= 1 

- and $$P(\phi$$) = 0 

- Proof sketch:

  - S = A $$\bigcup A^c$$ -> P(S) = P(A) + P($$A^c$$) = 1 -> P(A) <= 1

  And S = S $$\bigcup \phi$$ -> P(S) = P(S) + P($$\phi$$) ->



------



**important note** : The axioms don't make the choice of probability function unique 

there are many functions that satisfy the axioms 

the choice depends on the experiment setup

​	

------



The **Joint Probability** of events A and B is the probability of their intersection: 

P($$A \bigcap B$$) also written as P(AB)

P(A) + P(B) = P(A $\bigcup$ B) + P(A $\bigcap$ B)



------



The **Conditional Probability** denoted P(A|B) 

- measures the probability that A occurs given that B occurs 

Importance: we observe B but need to infer on whether some unobservable event A occurs 

Many examples in science, engineering, finance, and medicine

<center>Probability of A given B:

$$
P(A|B) = \frac{P(A \bigcap B)}{P(B)}
$$

​	We naturally assume that P(B) != 0



------



Justification on conditional probability 

- We know that B occurs, i.e., outcome belonds to B. so B now has probability 1, hence, it is the "effective" sample space

P(B|B) = 1 

normalize probabilities in the effective sample space by P(B) 

note that the only way A can occur now is if A $$\bigcap$$ B occurs 

(Hence equation from previous slide)



------



Example on Conditional Probability 

Fair die: let events A = {outcome <= 3} and B = {odd}

so A = { 1,2,3 } and B = { 1,3,5 }



P(A) = 3 * $\frac{1}{6} = \frac{1}{2}$ 

P($A \bigcap B) = \frac{1/3}{1/2}$ = $\frac{2}{3}$

Debt: need to show that the conditional probability as defined:
$$
P(A|B) = \frac{P(A \bigcap B)}{P(B)}
$$
is a valid probability function

- lets show it satisfies the 3 axioms:
  - 1) P(A|B) >= 0
    2) P(S|B) = 1
    3) let $A\bigcap C = \phi$ meaning A and C are mutually exclusive 
       1) then, P($A \bigcup C|B$) = $$\frac{P((A\bigcup C)\bigcap B)}{P(B)}$$
       2) ($$(A \bigcup C) \bigcap B = (A \bigcap B) \bigcup (C \bigcup B)$$)
       3) note that $(A \bigcap B)$ and $$(C \bigcap B)$$ are disjoint, so by axiom 3:
       4) $$ P((A \bigcup C)\bigcap B) = P(A \bigcap B) + P(C \bigcap B) $$
